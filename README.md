Ucto binding for Python
===========

This is a Python binding to the tokenizer Ucto. Tokenisation is one of the first step in almost any Natural Language Processing task, yet it is not always as trivial a task as it appears to be. This binding makes the power of the ucto tokeniser available to Python. Ucto itself is regular-expression based, extensible, and written in C++ (http://ilk.uvt.nl/ucto).

Installation
==============

 * Make sure to first install ucto itself (http://ilk.uvt.nl/ucto) and its dependencies
 * For Python 3 , run:  ``$ sudo setup.py install``
 * For Python 2 , run:  ``$ sudo setup2.py install``
